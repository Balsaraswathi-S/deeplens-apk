PROJECT TITLE

  DEEP LENS- FACE RECOGNITON 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

  The Project is to about recongnizing our faces and automatically update in the Zoho Check-in and Check-out API. 
  Person will be reconginzed and their data will be stored in the AWS S3 bucket. If the person comes and say "HI" on looking the Deep-Lens the lambda function will trigger and automatically updates in the Zoho API. 

  LANGUAGE USED: PYTHON (VERSION-3.6)
  
  KEY TERMS:
  
  AWSCLI :
        AWSCLI stands for AWS Command Line Interface used to configure the AWS.
  
  AWS Lambda: 
        It is the type of serverless computing used to run the program without server.
  
  AWS Rekognition:
        Used to recongize faces 
  
  AWS S3 Bucket:
        Data will be stored in the s3 bucket.

This can be done by having the device DEEP_LENS.

DEEP LENS: 
            It is the world's first deep learning video enable camera .
